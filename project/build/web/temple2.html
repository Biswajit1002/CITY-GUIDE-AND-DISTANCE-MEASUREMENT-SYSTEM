      <h5 class="w3-center"></h5>
      <p class="w3-large"> With the beautiful Daya River lying in the proximity, you have the ancient land of Dhauli that lets you know about the enormous battles that were fought here, the Kalinga War of 261 B.C. Buddhism for which Dhauli is so well known played a crucial role in transforming King Ashoka to a diehard Buddha devotee who eventually followed the preaching of Buddha for the rest of his life.Dhauli is famous for the edicts related to Buddhism that were composed from the Brahmi script and used Prakrit language. One can spot a series of rock cut monuments at this hill. Numerous artifacts tell us about the urban settlement at this place in the 3rd century B.C. One finds the image of intricately carved elephant and close to this elephant, you have a stupa.<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span> </p>

      <p class="w3-large">The temple in its present form dates back to the last decade of the eleventh century. There is evidence that part of the temple was built during the sixth century CE as mentioned in some of the seventh century Sanskrit texts.[6] Fergusson believes that the temple might have been initiated by Lalat Indu Keshari who reigned from 615 to 657 CE. The Assembly hall (jagamohana), sanctum and temple tower were built during the eleventh century, while the Hall of offering (bhoga-mandapa) was built during the twelfth century. The natamandira was built by the wife of Salini between 1099 and 1104 CE.[7] By the time the Lingaraja temple was completely constructed, the Jagannath (form of Vishnu) sect had been growing in the region, which historians believe, is evidenced by the co-existence of Vishnu and Shiva worship at the temple. The kings of Ganga dynasty were ardent followers of Vaishnavism, [shaivism] and [shaktism] and built the Jagannath Temple at Puri in the 12th century.<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span> </p>
